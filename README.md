XPS Tools 
=========

Fork of XNALara Mesh import/export tool with Blender 5.0 compatibility.

Since the original author (johnzero7) has not updated the code for five years as of 2025, the old version of the plugin can no longer run on the new version of Blender. Therefore, I will maintain this version going forward.

Original addon by XNALara community.

With Blender 4.40 released there where many changes.

From v2.1.0 of this addon will only work with Blender 4.4.
From v2.2.0 of this addon will only work with Blender 5.0.

- Blender 5.00 ==> v2.2.0+
- Blender 4.40 ==> v2.1.0

Blender Toolshelf, an addon for Blender to:

Import/Export XPS Models, Poses.

Main Features:
- Imports and Exports XPS/XNALara models with armature.
- Imports and Exports Poses
- Imports and Exports Custom Normals
- Creates Materials on import
- Easily set a new rest pose for the model

### Tips

- We have switched the default export format to ASCII and disabled the binary XPS option due to persistent compatibility bugs.
- ASCII is highly reliable and should work seamlessly for everyone.
- I am still working on my technical skills and haven't found a permanent fix for the binary issue yet—if anyone in the community can help, I would greatly appreciate a code submission on GitHub. Thanks for sticking with me!
